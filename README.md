## How to work on this repositories

0. I assume that all of us is working on mac therefore I will only refer to the mac environment.
1. You will need to install git on your computer, you can find an explanation on how to do it [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2. Once you have git installed you can clone a repository on your computer to work on it locally if you wish. To do that you have to open terminal and go to the directory where you want to download the files to do that use the command<br>
```cd path/to/directory```<br>
if you can't remember the whole path to the directory than simply drag and drop the folder onto the terminal (but don't forget to type `cd` and a white space before). To clone the the directory in the termonal you need to type<br>
```git clone theUrlOfTheRepository.git```<br>
for example ```git clone https://github.com/commoningtoys/PredatorVSPreyModel.git```<br>
To get the url of the repository click on the _Clone or Download_ button and copy the url.

3. Now you should have a copy of the repository on your computer. For each project there will always be branches with your names, if you want to work on the code please run this command on the terminal <br>
`git checkout shintaro`<br>
please never work on the `master` branch!

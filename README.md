## How to work on this repository

0. I assume that all of us is working on mac therefore I will only refer to the mac environment.
1. You will need to install git on your computer, you can find an explanation on how to do it [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2. Once you have git installed you can clone a repository on your computer to work on it locally if you wish. To do that you have to open terminal and go to the directory where you want to download the files to do that use the command<br>
```cd path/to/directory```<br>
if you can't remember the whole path to the directory than simply drag and drop the folder onto the terminal (but don't forget to type `cd` and a white space before). To clone the the directory in the termonal you need to type<br>
```git clone theUrlOfTheRepository.git```<br>
